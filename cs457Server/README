*Simple Chat Program*
*********************

How to compile the source:
==========================
Run make in the same directory as the chat.c and makefile.
You can also compile and link manually using the following;
$ gcc -D_POSIX_SOURCE -std=c99 -o chat chat.c


Usage:
======
$	./chat [-s <ip address> -p <port>]


How to run as the server:
=========================
$ ./chat

Example output:
Waiting for a connection on 129.82.45.248 port 61723


How to run as the client:
=========================
$ ./chat -p 61723 -s 129.82.45.248

Example output:
Connecting to server... Connected!
Connected to a friend! You send first.

Questions I asked the TA (Awad)
===============================
I asked Awad about the process of creating the correct packet structure.
Below is copied from an email thread we had. I ended up not doing what 
I proposed because there was a much simpler way of accomplishing the
prepending of the version and string size to the packet, you can
this in my source code.

Scott:
I plan on doing the following, can you confirm if the following pseudo code for creating the packet is the right idea?

uint16_t version = 457;
char versionlo = version & 0xFF;
char versionhi = version >> 8;

unit16_t msgSize = sizeof(msg);
char msgSizeLo = msgSize & 0xFF;
char msgSizeHi = msgSize >> 8;

Then create the packet by concatenating the newly created chars and msg into a char array. Send the char array packet and on the other end reverse the process.

Awad:
it looks great to me.
good luck.
